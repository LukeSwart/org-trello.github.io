### Emacs version tested

Tested on:

- GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, Xaw3d scroll bars) of 2013-04-14 on marid, modified by Debian (from 0.1.0)
- GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.6.0) of 2014-01-03 on chindi02, modified by Debian
- GNU Emacs 24.3.50.1 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.24.22) of 2014-03-08 on dagobah

### CI

The continuous integration is able to test, compile and install org-trello with the following emacs versions:

- 24.1
- 24.2
- 24.3

But I:

- do not have time to ensure that org-trello works with versions inferior to 24.3.
- did not had any feedback from users reporting emacs versions different than the one tested
